## Hi there, I'm Julian, also known as Jolomolokolo! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 16-year-old tech enthusiast from Germany who loves exploring various fields in technology. Whether it's CAD design, circuit board creation, web development, or coding in Python and JavaScript, I'm always experimenting and learning new things. I also have a strong interest in servers and virtualization, especially with Proxmox.

I enjoy diving into new projects and pushing my boundaries to discover new possibilities. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or chat about tech!
